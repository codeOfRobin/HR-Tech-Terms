Be it Stack Overflow, hasjob, angel.co or whatever is new in town (don‚Äôt even **think** about LinkedIn. That‚Äôs just an ad/spam network masquerading as a professional social network).
Not in the ‚Äúgenerate a vaccum so as to aid the flow of matter‚Äù way. They‚Äôre massively opaque, filled with useless jargon, and don‚Äôt do a good job of communicating a job's requirements, opportunities and learnings to a prospective applicant. And it‚Äôs **not** because HRs are ignorant/don‚Äôt give a flying fuck.

The simple reason for that is, the world of building software is **complicated. **In a world with a new Javascript framework every day (hello React!) and new innovations happening (iMessage extensions, Ô£ø tvOS apps, Android weawr etc), it‚Äôs nearly impossible for people to stay abreast with everything latest, let alone an HR manager, who is burdened wtih non tech hiring as well.

So, here‚Äôs a definitive guide to various tech buzzwords and frameworks, grouped broadly over disciplines.
These definitions aren‚Äôt meant to be exhaustive or even technically accurate. However, it will help you make the Job descriptions detailed enough, mildly accurate and less cringeworthy.


# Backend Dev

Backend = stuff happening on servers.


1. Python - snak-ey language. General Purpose, but in this context usually refers to someone building Django/Flask apps.
2. Node.js - *who thought this was a good idea?* Again, General purpose, but refers to the Npm(node package manager) ecosystem stuff like express.js, HAPI.js, or Adonis.js 
3. PHP - Probably the most common of the bunch. Laravel is relatively a modern framework, and there‚Äôs lots of others (we use a custom built one here at Kayako).
4. Ruby - typically used with frameworks in Sinatra and Rails. Optimised for Programmer happiness
5. Shameless Plug for swift even though very few orgs use it. üòû Might become big in the future. Perfect, Kitura(by IBM), Vapor, Zewo are the biggest contenders)


# Frontend Dev

Stuff that happens in the browser


1. React.js - Facebook built this. Supposedly super great
2. Ember.js - Open source. Really popular amongst hipster people (Apple built the thing that eventually became ember)
3. Angular.js - Google built this, most common one, but google doesn‚Äôt use it in any of its products.
4. Jquery - makes building stuff easier
5. Other smaller frameworks include - vue.js etc
6. EDIT: Elm is another language.


# Mobile Dev
