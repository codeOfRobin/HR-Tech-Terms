Be it Stack Overflow, hasjob, angel.co or whatever is new in town (don't even **think** about LinkedIn. That's just an ad/spam network masquerading as a professional social network).
Not in the “generate a vaccum so as to aid the flow of matter” way. They're massively opaque, filled with useless jargon, and don't do a good job of communicating a job's requirements, opportunities and learnings to a prospective applicant. And it's **not** because HRs are ignorant/don't give a flying fuck.

The simple reason for that is, the world of building software is **complicated. **In a world with a new Javascript framework every day (hello React!) and new innovations happening (iMessage extensions,  tvOS apps, Android weawr etc), it's nearly impossible for people to stay abreast with everything latest, let alone an HR manager, who is burdened wtih non tech hiring as well.

So, here's a definitive guide to various tech buzzwords and frameworks, grouped broadly over disciplines.
These definitions aren't meant to be exhaustive or even technically accurate. However, it will help you make the Job descriptions detailed enough, mildly accurate and less cringeworthy.
