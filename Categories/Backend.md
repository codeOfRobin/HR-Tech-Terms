# Backend

Backend = stuff happening on servers.

1. Python - snak-ey language. General Purpose, but in this context usually refers to someone building Django/Flask apps.
2. Node.js - *who thought this was a good idea?* Again, General purpose, but refers to the Npm(node package manager) ecosystem stuff like express.js, HAPI.js, or Adonis.js 
3. PHP - Probably the most common of the bunch. Laravel is relatively a modern framework, and there's lots of others (we use a custom built one here at Kayako).
4. Ruby - typically used with frameworks in Sinatra and Rails. Optimised for Programmer happiness
5. Shameless Plug for swift even though very few orgs use it. ðŸ˜ž Might become big in the future. Perfect, Kitura(by IBM), Vapor, Zewo are the biggest contenders)
