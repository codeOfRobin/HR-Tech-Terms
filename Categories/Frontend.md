# Frontend Dev

Stuff that happens in the browser


1. React.js - Facebook built this. Supposedly super great
2. Ember.js - Open source. Really popular amongst hipster people (Apple built the thing that eventually became ember)
3. Angular.js - Google built this, most common one, but google doesn't use it in any of its products.
4. Jquery - makes building stuff easier
5. Other smaller frameworks include - vue.js etc
6. EDIT: Elm is another language.
